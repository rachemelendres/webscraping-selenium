# Webscraping Project using Selenium

This repository contains the code and data for my webscraping project using Selenium. The goal of this project was to collect job listings from a government [website](https://csc.gov.ph/career/) and store them in a CSV file for further analysis. I used Python and Selenium to write a scraping bot that can navigate the website and extract the relevant information.
